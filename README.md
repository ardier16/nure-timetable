# NURE Timetable

The web timetable for NURE students. Uses [CIST API](http://cist.nure.ua/ias/app/f?p=778:900:1239415597271026::NO) to get timetable data.

## Live Demo

You can see the working demo [here](https://ardier16.neocities.org/). But it can't work with the API, 'cause the hosting uses HTTPs while the API uses HTTP. Instead of it the app works with sample timetable data.

## Project Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
